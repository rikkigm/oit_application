# oit_application
Assumptions:
That each github user has an accessible github email.
That an smtp server is available for the person running the code.

To Run:
Open project in visual studio and modify the variables at the top of the main controller page to match the aws and github information.

To know:
I personally didn't have access to an smtp server to test out the code that sends email. But that code was taken from the example on msdn website.
It will display what should be stored in aws on the web page that is displayed.
